# Readable App
This app has been developed as a requirement for the second module of Udacity's React Nanodegree course. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running the app
First, clone or download the source code. Once you have the code, navigate to the folder `frontend` and then run `npm install` to install the dependencies of the project. After the dependencies are installed, you have to run `npm start` to start the app. In this version of the project you don't have to start a local server, as a data API is available on data-readable.wedeploy.io.
